Wiz-Bot is a self initiated project by National University of Singapore (NUS) students which is developed for Discord servers.

We provide users the abilities to:

- Use Custom Reactions
- Set Reminders
- Play Music from Youtube
- Emote an emoji
- React a message using command
- Quote a message sent in the server

We also plan to let the bot has:
- Levels and Reputations System
- Mini Games
- and many more!

This project is currently under development phase. Stay tune for more information.
